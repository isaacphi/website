<h1 id="phil_isaac_now_has_a_website">Phil Isaac now has a website</h1>

<p>Reading week has brought about little reading but has at least given me the chance to get some work done on this website. I was originally just curious about how a website comes about and wanted to build one up from scratch. Because, well, that’s just the way I am. I didn’t know the first thing about web design and wanted to make a simple website mainly just for the learning experience. What better chance to get a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_URL">vanity domain</a> up and running.</p>

<p>I soon came to realize that the web is an entirely different beast from what I’m used to. My experience with code up to this point had mostly been some variant of</p>

<ol>
<li>Recognize problem</li>

<li>Formulate solution</li>

<li>Write python script</li>

<li>Boom, problem solved</li>
</ol>

<p>Of course step three could be shell scripts calling C code, assembly, arduino code, android stuff etc. But the idea is the same. There is more or less one thing that you have to worry about at a time. Most of the pages I read about web design seemed to be written in a completely foreign language. What was a css and why did I need to javascript (or jquery?) it?</p>

<p>Although it all makes so much sense to me now, I was originally baffled by the number of things that keep the gears of the world wide web turning.</p>

<h1 id="a_website_is_born">A website is born</h1>

<p>I would have loved to make a retro full ascii website with monospace font and ascii art everywhere. I also wanted something more akin to all those hip startup websites you see everywhere - some may critisize them for being so similar but the single page scrolling webiste is damn sexy and intuitive.</p>

<p>My first page (below) was an attempt to be too much at once. It was also my training grounds in pure html, css, and javascript. Most importantly, it was a testament to just how messy and ugly those languages could get.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.philisaac.com/img/postpics/old_site_screenshot.png" alt="First prototype" /></p>

<p>I was having a lot of trouble getting the site to do what I wanted with the background picture, adapt to fit any screen, and display those stupid slashes on the side. I was being too hard on myself. I soon came to realize how this stuff is supposed to be done.</p>

<h1 id="a_website_reborn">A website reborn</h1>

<p>I had originally only used html, css, and a touch of javascript to not bog myself down with too much learning and to keep things simple. Maybe because I feel more comfortable with a solid understanding of the basics, maybe because school has taught me to not stray too far from the basic guidelines. Sure that stuff is important, but my thought about keeping things simple couldn’t have been more misguided.</p>

<p>That’s not how things are done.</p>

<p>The stack on the current version of the website looks a bit more like</p>

<ul>
<li>html</li>

<li><a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a></li>

<li><a href="http://sass-lang.com/">sass</a></li>

<li>javascript</li>

<li><a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">foundation</a></li>

<li><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Everything became dead easy once I realized that developers everywhere have put in countless hours so that I could make my website easily, cleanly, and without the grunt work. I wish someone had been there to tell me that learning to use foundation after knowing html would take minutes and save hours.</p>

<p>Now that it’s done, I feel like a fool for not using <a href="http://haml.info/">haml</a> and <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">coffeescript</a> as well. The lesson here? Put in the time to learn the tools. Embrace them.</p>

<p>I have consulted far too many guides to be able to recommend a solid tutorial for starting off making a website from scratch. My only advice would be to read lots before diving in and tinkering around. I know this goes against the method of just about every creator that I know, myself included. It pays off in the long run though.</p>

<p>Side note, I’m using the (wonderful) services of namecheap and <a href="http://pages.github.com/">github pages</a> with jekyll for the blog.</p>

<h1 id="moving_forward">Moving forward</h1>

<p>What’s next? I’ll post some stuff to this blog - hardly my daily journal, what with the impending time-suck of university. I’ll post about some side projects I’m working on and perhaps guides if there’s much worth sharing.</p>

<p>I’m not sure web development is for me, not that I can claim to know too much about it. I have had a run in with ruby and html canvas with battle AI (ongoing project - I’ll write a post about it soon or when it’s done, whichever comes first) which has been fun though, so we’ll see.</p>

<p>It’s been a fun experience setting up the site. Until next time.</p>
