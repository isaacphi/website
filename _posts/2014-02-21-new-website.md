# Phil Isaac now has a website

Reading week has brought about little reading but has at least given me
the chance to get some work done on this website. I was originally
just curious about how a website comes into being and wanted to build one
up from scratch. Because, well, that's just the way I am. I didn't know the first
thing about web design and wanted to make a simple website primarily
for the learning experience. What better chance to get a
[vanity domain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_URL)
up and running.

I soon came to realize that the web is an entirely different beast
from what I'm used to. My experience with code up to this
point had mostly been some variant of

1. Recognize problem
2. Formulate solution
3. Write python script
4. Boom, problem solved

Of course step three could be arduino code, shell scripts calling C code, 
assembly, android stuff etc. But the idea is the same. There is
more or less one thing that you have to worry about at a time. When I started 
reading about web, most of the pages I read seemed to be written in a completely
foreign language. What was a css and why did I need to javascript (or
jquery?) it?

Although it all makes so much sense to me now, I was originally
baffled by the number of things that keep the gears of the world wide
web turning.

# A website is born

I would have loved to make a retro style full ascii website with monospace
font and ascii art everywhere. I also wanted
something more akin to one of those dangerously hip startup websites - some may 
critisize them for being so similar but the
single page scroller is damn sexy and intuitive.

My first page (below) was an attempt to be too much at once. It was
also my training grounds in pure html, css, and javascript. Most
importantly, it was a testament to just how messy and ugly those
languages could get.

I was having a lot of trouble getting the site to do what I wanted
with the background picture, adapt to fit any screen, and display
those stupid slashes on the side. I was being too hard on myself. I
soon came to realize how this stuff is supposed to be done.

# A website reborn

I had originally only used html, css, and a touch of
javascript as to not bog myself down with too much learning and to keep
things simple. Maybe because I feel more comfortable with a solid
understanding of the basics, maybe because school has taught me to not
stray too far from the basic guidelines. Sure that stuff is important,
but my thought about keeping things simple couldn't have been more
misguided. Or, rather, I was keeping things simple in the wrong way.

That's not how things are done.

The stack on the current version of the website looks a bit more like
* html
* [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
* [sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
* javascript
* [foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)
* [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)

Everything became dead easy once I realized that developers everywhere
had put in countless hours so that I could make my website easily,
cleanly, and without the grunt work. I wish someone had been there to
tell me that learning to use foundation after knowing html would take
minutes and save hours.

Now that the website is done (or pseudo-done: always a work in progress),
 I feel like a fool for not using
[haml](http://haml.info/) and [coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/)
as well. The lesson here? Put in the time to learn the tools. Embrace them.

I have consulted far too many guides to be able to recommend a solid
tutorial for starting off making a website from scratch. My only advice
would be to read lots before diving in and tinkering around. I know
this goes against the method of just about every creator that I know,
myself included. It pays off in the long run though.

Side note, I'm using the (wonderful) services of namecheap and
[github pages](http://pages.github.com/) with jekyll for the blog. Also, the 
pictures at the top of the [home](http://www.philisaac.com) and 
[blog](http://www.philisaac.com/blog) pages are all taken by me. I'll
add more as I take more.

It's been a fun experience setting up the site. Until next time.
