# Remember when hacking was a bad thing?

I remember when hackers were criminals on TV shows. It seems that the meaning has
shifted from there a bit to the MIT definition of the term. Hackers are now just clever people who solve problems,
people who use tools for good, or for fun. Or use tools in ways they haven't been
used before or aren't meant to be used. People who break things for fun and build
new things. That's pretty cool.

I also remember when hackers weren't cool. I had this image of some smelly nerd
wasting time on a computer with stuff nobody cared about. As far as I know this 
image still persists and I'm just so surrounded by the smelly nerds that I don't
notice (probably the case). The public perception of "hacking" is definitly changing though,
just look at the [hour of code](http://csedweek.org/) or the popularity of sites
like [code academy](http://www.codecademy.com/dashboard) <-- where I learned to
code BTW.

I'm not here to talk about the image of coding and hacking though. I'm just here
to talk about why I love it so much.

I mean, hackathons are great.

Think about it: Dream up an awesome idea. Learn a bunch of new tools. Get 
your friends excited about it. Bus to another city. All nighter hacking. Free food
and swag. Meet new people. Share ideas. Get more ideas. 

That's what I'm all about. That's worth bussing 12 hours away to New York city for
the weekend before exams. That's worth no sleep. There's something about being
able to focus on one thing for so long, even if it's some idea you never end up
revisiting. Something about the atmosphere. Ambition is contagous.

At the end you've built something new. There's nothing else like seeing something
real that was only an idea 36 hours ago. I never thought I'd be so excited about this:

Just some dumb title screen. But when you see it, you know your code worked.
Trivia fact: the above is the title screen for the to be completed (one day) Battle.ai,
an online platform to help people learn to code by making and battling classic arcade game AI's,
inspired by code academy.

So yeah, I hope I never stop building and designing, no matter where I am. I also
hope that the public can learn to appreciate us ~~smelly~~ nerds who love to design
and build and learn.

Above: that feel when you do damn well at a coding competition after coming dead
last place the year before because you had showed up with a barebones team and learned
to code on the car ride to Quebec because why the hell not and now you're about to go
back to the hardest week of school ever which you havn't prepared for because you've
been busy learning to use 5 new APIs.

I'm on the right. Cheers to more hacking in my future.
