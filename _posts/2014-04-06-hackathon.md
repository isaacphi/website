# Phil Isaac now has a website

Reading week has brought about little reading but has at least given me
the chance to get some work done on this website. I was originally
just curious about how a website comes about and wanted to build one
up from scratch. Because, well, that's just the way I am. I didn't know the first
thing about web design and wanted to make a simple website mainly just
for the learning experience. What better chance to get a
[vanity domain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_URL)
up and running.

I soon came to realize that the web is an entirely different beast
from what I'm used to. My experience with code up to this
point had mostly been some variant of

1. Recognize problem
2. Formulate solution
3. Write python script
4. Boom, problem solved

Of course step three could be shell scripts calling C code, assembly,
arduino code, android stuff etc. But the idea is the same. There is
more or less one thing that you have to worry about at a time. Most of
the pages I read about web design seemed to be written in a completely
foreign language. What was a css and why did I need to javascript (or
jquery?) it?

Although it all makes so much sense to me now, I was originally
baffled by the number of things that keep the gears of the world wide
web turning.

# A website is born

I would have loved to make a retro full ascii website with monospace
font and ascii art everywhere. I also wanted
something more akin to all those hip startup websites you see
everywhere - some may critisize them for being so similar but the
single page scrolling webiste is damn sexy and intuitive.

My first page (below) was an attempt to be too much at once. It was
also my training grounds in pure html, css, and javascript. Most
importantly, it was a testament to just how messy and ugly those
languages could get.

I was having a lot of trouble getting the site to do what I wanted
with the background picture, adapt to fit any screen, and display
those stupid slashes on the side. I was being too hard on myself. I
soon came to realize how this stuff is supposed to be done.

# A website reborn

I had originally only used html, css, and a touch of
javascript to not bog myself down with too much learning and to keep
things simple. Maybe because I feel more comfortable with a solid
understanding of the basics, maybe because school has taught me to not
stray too far from the basic guidelines. Sure that stuff is important,
but my thought about keeping things simple couldn't have been more
misguided.

That's not how things are done.

The stack on the current version of the website looks a bit more like
* html
* [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
* [sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
* javascript
* [foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)
* [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)

Everything became dead easy once I realized that developers everywhere
have put in countless hours so that I could make my website easily,
cleanly, and without the grunt work. I wish someone had been there to
tell me that learning to use foundation after knowing html would take
minutes and save hours.

Now that it's done, I feel like a fool for not using
[haml](http://haml.info/) and [coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/)
as well. The lesson here? Put in the time to learn the tools. Embrace them.

I have consulted far too many guides to be able to recommend a solid
tutorial for starting off making a website from scratch. My only advice
would be to read lots before diving in and tinkering around. I know
this goes against the method of just about every creator that I know,
myself included. It pays off in the long run though.

Side note, I'm using the (wonderful) services of namecheap and
[github pages](http://pages.github.com/) with jekyll for the blog.

# Moving forward

What's next? I'll post some stuff to this blog - hardly my daily
journal, what with the impending time-suck of university. I'll post about
some side projects I'm working on and perhaps guides if there's much
worth sharing.

I'm not sure web development is for me, not that I can claim to know
too much about it. I have had a run in with ruby and html canvas with battle AI
(ongoing project - I'll write a post about it soon or when it's done,
whichever comes first) which has been fun though, so we'll see.

It's been a fun experience setting up the site. Until next time.
