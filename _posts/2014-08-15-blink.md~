# Don't Blink

The first thing I tried when I put on the google cardboard was to try to blink to
click. after all there is a front facing camera. Surely google would have figured
out how to use this for a simple eye tracker. Alas it didn't work.

Here is my attempt to impliment blink to click for the google cardboard. More
to come once my prototype is in working order.
