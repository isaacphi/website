Lately I have been helping out with [PheedLoop](http://pheedloop.com). It's been
fun, challenging, and rewarding all at the same time. I really love the product
and the team and thanks to our kind mentors and early adopters, it has been
exciting and exhilarating so far.

I really like the core principals behind PheedLoop and how they came about. Check
out [our blog post about it](http://blog.pheedloop.com/feedback-loops/).

What have I learned so far?
* It's near impossible to balance two jobs
* [django](djangoproject.com) development isn't as hard as it looks. I have to respect the developers.
* Marketing isn't easy. Perhaps the others in companies don't get enough respect from the engineers.
* You can't make a perfect product for everybody. You'll have to make a lot of changes from the beginning.
