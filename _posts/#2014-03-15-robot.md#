      &ldquo;What has been your favorite course at university so far?&rdquo;</br></br>
      &mdash;Interviewer</blockquote>

Complicated answer. Here's why.

# AER201

This engineering design course is known as the bane of the engineering science
program at U of T, and with good reason. This one course consumes more time than
the other 5 equally weighted courses we take at the same time. With its difficult
design milestones and several multi-hundred page reports, it seems hardly fair. 
Here's why I loved it:

# The mission

Let's start with what we were expected to accomplish: Work in a team of three to
design and build a fully functional autonomous robot capable 
of packaging ping pong balls. More specifically:

* Propose a complete design for the robot
* Justify all design decisions with research, simulations, prototypes.
* Decide upon and follow sound engineering design and managerial frameworks
* Each member individually completes one of: mechanical, electrical, or software subsystem
* Integration of subsystems
* Complete documentation

Ok, doesn't sound that bad. Keep in mind though that this was second year and
being told to simply build a robot was pretty intimidating. Let's 
look at my qualifications at the time

* Can solve abstract circuit problems that one would never encounter in practice
* Can solve abstract programming problems that one would never encounter in practice
* Dazzling personality
* Good at math

Fine, but simply they'll teach us what we need to know though right?
Things we were taught:

* how to make a Gantt chart for time management
* Where to find the 400 page long microcontroller manual
* V = IR

...well shit

# It's ok though

The point I'm trying to make is that we were more or less left on our own -- which
felt terrible at the time. In hindsight it may have been the best learning experience
I've has so far at school. I'm very greatful that we had a the chance at a design
course and some hands on work in only second year.

# Conception to Completion

My role was to program a [PIC microcontroller](https://www.microchip.com/ParamChartSearch/Chart.aspx?branchID=1004)
in assembly and interface it with sensors. I helped out with the circuits too.
Trolling through that 400 page manual (and many others) definitly did me good.
It turns out that the task was completeable in the end. We just had to get in the
mindset of teaching ourselves and powering through what seemed to be impossible
amounts of work.

It was remarkable to see

Which was one of my first sketches about a mechanism, end up as part of a full
fledged functional machine:

# Lessons?

The first lesson was that after you complete three fully functional subsystems,
putting them together aint nothing like lego bricks. More importantly though:

The answer to why this was my favorite course so far is that I feel much more empowered
now. How so? Looking at a robot project back when I knew nothing about anything was
an intimidating thing. So were 400 page manuals about assembly code that are written
for professionals in industry. But somehow we got through.

Now when I look at some challenge, I'm 100% sure I can do it if I put my mind to it.
This is one of the reasons I got more into software outside of school after this project.
It also got me into hobbiest electronics and robotics. I have an arduino now that
I've been having fun with. My next project is a CNC whiteboard printer.

One more thing: seeing a project all the way through gives you a certain attachment
to it. Watching the video above makes me cringe for two reasons. The first being 
the memories of the all nighters. The second being the desire to fix up everything
that I realize in hindsight we did terribly wrong. I would definitely have made a
few decisions differently.

thank the great team Carson Clark and Thomas Dingle.
